**Introduction:**
Weather prediction is an essential aspect of our daily lives, as it affects our daily routines, travel 
plans, and outdoor activities. A weather predicting app is valuable for individuals planning their 
activities based on current and upcoming weather conditions. In this proposal, we present a plan 
for a weather predicting app that uses datasets from the National Weather Service. Our app aims 
to provide up-to-date weather predictions for users.

**Background:**
The National Weather Service (NWS) provides comprehensive weather data, including real-time 
observations, forecasts, and warnings. The NWS collects this data through a network of weather 
stations, satellites, and radars across the United States. This data is freely available and accessible 
through various APIs. This data is what our application will be built and tested on.

**Goal/features:**
Our weather predicting app will leverage the datasets provided by the National Weather Service to 
provide users with accurate weather predictions. The app will have several features, including:
1. Forecasting: The app will provide users with detailed weather forecasts for the next several 
days. The forecasts will include information on temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and 
direction.
2. Historical data: The app will provide users with access to historical weather data for any 
location. Users can view data for any specific date and time.
Data Collection:
The app will use the following datasets from the National Weather Service:
1. Real-time observations
2. Forecasts
3. Alerts and warnings
4. Historical data

**Technical Implementation:**
The app will be developed using pythonâ€™s machine learning frameworks to interact with the 
National Weather Service datasets to provide weather predictions. For the sake of time available, 
simple machine learning techniques will be explored.
Technical Challenges:
One of the technical challenges of developing a weather predicting app is dealing with the large 
amounts of data provided by the National Weather Service. We will need to optimize our app's 
data processing and storage capabilities to provide fast weather information. 

**Conclusion:**
Our weather predicting app will provide valuable weather information to users, leveraging 
datasets provided by the National Weather Service. Our goal is to develop a user-friendly and 
reliable weather predicting app that meets the needs of users and helps them plan their activities 
based on accurate and up-to-date weather information. The availability of rich datasets will help 
the development/completion of the project.
